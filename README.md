The files connected to my research internship connected with the Princeton ECE Department summer 2023 

Robotics & ML Project Princeton ECE dept. Internship ~ Wearable Motion Detector
- Designed and constructed an innovative motion sensor waistband, with integrated Arduino and IMU sensors.
- Conducted comprehensive data collection, PCA and TSNE analysis of 8,000 points of 10-dimensional movement data. 
- Leveraged Python-based data processing tools, including Scikit-Learn, SciPy, Tensor Flow, and PyTorch, to analyze the data and create various classification algorithms in the form of KNNs, decision trees and SVMs.
- Only code available up to PCA analysis to protect data and obey honour code.
